= Best Practices to Organize Work When Developers Are Assigned to 3+ Projects

This document describes a practical framework used by PMOs in outsourcing companies where developers are assigned to *multiple concurrent projects*. The practices below help reduce chaos, improve predictability, and increase focus while maintaining high utilization.

== 1. Create a Single Weekly Allocation Plan (Capacity Matrix)

Every week, define a clear allocation of each developer's time across all active projects.

=== Weekly Allocation Table (Example)

|===
| Developer | Project A | Project B | Project C | Bench/Other

| Dev1 | 50% | 30% | 20% | 0%
| Dev2 | 100% | 0% | 0% | 10% support
| Dev3 | 30% | 50% | 20% | 
|===

=== Rules
* Never plan more than *85%* of capacity to leave room for meetings, support, and unexpected work.
* Always assign a *primary project* (≥60% focus when possible).
* Developers must know their “#1 priority” for the week.

This minimizes harmful context switching.

== 2. Weekly Planning Ceremony (PMO–Developer Sync)

A short, structured weekly meeting where each developer answers three questions:
1. What are your priorities by project this week?
2. What blocks you?
3. Do you have enough capacity or are you overloaded?

The PMO:
* Resolves priority conflicts.
* Adjusts allocation percentages.
* Communicates final weekly priorities to all PMs and stakeholders.

== 3. Tiered Priority System

Define a shared prioritization model for all projects:

=== Priority Tiers
* *Tier 1 – Critical:* deadlines, escalations, SLA items.
* *Tier 2 – Important:* major deliverables but not urgent.
* *Tier 3 – Low priority:* minor tasks, internal activities.

A Tier 1 task always overrides lower tiers.

== 4. Use Kanban Instead of Sprint Planning

Scrum becomes inefficient when developers support multiple projects. Kanban with WIP limits is a more effective model.

=== Recommendations
* Use personal or cross-project Kanban boards.
* Limit WIP to *1–2 active tasks* per developer.
* Developers pull tasks from the highest-priority project.

This reduces context switching and increases flow efficiency.

== 5. Monthly Rolling Forecast

Maintain a 4–8 week forecast of developer allocation to improve planning and predictability.

=== Rolling Forecast Example

|===
| Developer | Jan W1 | Jan W2 | Jan W3 | Jan W4 | Feb W1

| Dev1 | Project A | Project A | Project B | Project B | Project C
| Dev2 | Project A | Project A | Project A | Project A | Project A
| Dev3 | Project C | Project C | Project A | Project A | Project B
|===

This helps manage future workloads and identify availability early.

== 6. Use Shared Tools to Ensure Visibility

Recommended toolset:
* *Jira or Azure DevOps:* Tasks, boards, workload dashboards.
* *MS Teams or Slack:* Communication channels per project.
* *Excel/Google Sheets:* Weekly allocation matrix (source of truth).

PMO should maintain:
* Weekly allocation sheet.
* Risk register.
* Developer availability calendar.
* Project priority list.

== 7. Limit Context Switching

Splitting a developer across too many projects per week destroys productivity.

=== Guidelines
* Prefer no more than *2 projects per developer per week*.
* Use weekly blocks: e.g.,  
  **Mon–Tue → Project A**,  
  **Wed → Project B**,  
  **Thu → Project C**,  
  **Fri → catch-up**.

== 8. Implement Focus Hours

Protect *2–3 hours/day* for uninterrupted work.  
Developers disable notifications and focus on deep work.

== 9. Track Context-Switching Costs

Each project switch costs *20–40 minutes* of cognitive reset.

Use this as an argument to push back when stakeholders request “just one small task”.

== 10. Summary: The Three Most Important Practices

If you implement only three elements, you will solve 90% of the issues:

* *One weekly allocation plan.*
* *One shared prioritization model.*
* *Kanban with strict WIP limits.*

Everything else is a scaling improvement.
